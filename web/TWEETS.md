# Drip — 20 Launch Tweets

## Research Notes
- Competitors (MemeLiquid, RektioDEX) focus on meme culture + degen trading
- HyperLiquid relies on organic community, whale screenshots, product-first marketing
- Percolator angle (toly/formally verified) is unique differentiator — no other Solana perp DEX has this
- Key themes: formally verified, open source, toly connection, meme perps, not a fork, pro terminal

my brother in christ, hyperliquid isn't on solana.

drip is. 50x leverage. formally verified. sub-second settlement.

**10.**
long FARTCOIN 10x on a formally verified engine is the most intellectually honest trade in crypto

**11.**
the virgin unverified perps protocol:
- "trust us bro"
- copy-paste contracts
- pray the math works

the chad formally verified engine:
- math-proven correctness
- open source
- built by toly

if your perps DEX isn't formally verified, your liquidation engine is just vibes

toly said "someone should just steal this and build on it"

so we did.

drip — a perpetual futures terminal built on the percolator engine. open source. formally verified. live now.

**16.**
the percolator engine uses a slab architecture that processes trades in parallel.

what does that mean for you? your 50x SOL long fills before you finish reading this tweet.

## Tutorials / Educational

**17.**
how to trade FARTCOIN perps on solana:

1. go to drip.trade
2. connect your wallet
3. select FARTCOIN-PERP
4. set leverage (up to 10x)
5. long or short
6. set your TP/SL
7. execute

that's it. no KYC. no sign-up. just connect and trade.

**18.**
cross margin vs isolated margin — explained:

cross: your entire account balance backs every position. more efficient, but one bad trade can affect everything.

isolated: each position has its own margin. risk is contained.

drip supports both. choose your style →

## Competitive Positioning

**19.**
solana perps landscape:

- jupiter: 3 markets, massive volume
- drift: the OG, 101x leverage
- drip: formally verified, 11 markets, pro terminal

we're not competing on volume yet.
we're competing on trust. because our math is proven.

**20.**
every perps protocol on solana is one bug away from catastrophe.

except the one built on a formally verified engine.

drip. trade with confidence.
